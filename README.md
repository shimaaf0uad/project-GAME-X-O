# project-GAME-X-O

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) game, designed for two players to compete on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three symbols (X or O) in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—while offering a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Project Structure
- **`index.html`**: The main entry point providing the game interface.
- **`css/`**: Contains styling files to enhance the visual appeal and layout.
- **`js/`**: Houses JavaScript files managing game logic and interactivity.
- **`README.md`**: This document detailing the project.

## Key Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Alternating turns for players using X and O symbols.
- **Game Outcome Detection**: Automatically identifies a win or draw condition.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows players to start a new game instantly.

## Technical Stack
- **HTML5**: Forms the structural foundation of the game.
- **CSS3**: Ensures a polished and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the game mechanics and user interactions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shimaaf0uad/project-GAME-X-O.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. Launch the game by opening `index.html` in a web browser.

## How to Play
- Open the game in your browser.
- Player 1 (X) begins by clicking any empty cell on the 3x3 grid.
- Player 2 (O) follows, with turns alternating until a winner emerges or the grid is full.
- A message will display the result (win or draw), and a "Restart" button resets the game.

## Future Enhancements
- Introduce a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
- Implement a scoring system to track player performance.
- Add visual animations for winning combinations.
- Integrate audio cues for enhanced engagement.
